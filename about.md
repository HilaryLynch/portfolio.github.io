Hello, world! My name is Hilary Lynch, and I am happy that you made it to my website to learn more about me. I have a background in Biomedical Engineering, which stemmed from my love of math & physics with my interest in biological systems. From academic research at Georgia Tech, to R&D work at a large medical device company, through time at a SAAS while taking Johns Hopkins computer science courses, I have quite a diverse background that has taught me how to learn new things fast while paying attention to the details. I will be starting my Master's in Computer Science this fall at Georgia Tech, to further my education in this exciting and interesting field.
