Welcome to my first post on my Jekyll site. Over the past few years, I have gone from Biomedical Engineering, jumped to the booming field of eCommerce in customer service, QA, technical writing for documentation, and finally stirred my passion for software development and computer science.

To showcase my work and progress, I've created this static website (using Jekyll), to start a portfolio.

If you are ever interested in learning more, or want to start a site of your own, send me a message or find further Jekyll documents here:
